## 2. #albumsyoumusthear playlists
I know some of you don't use Spotify... I use it because it is the most popular music platform, hence you are likely to find more add-ons and tools for your music journey. In any case, you can use services like [Soundsgood](http://soundsgood.co/) to convert your playlist into your favorite music platform.

## 6. Scrobbling from radio
I know this has been an issue for some time but I found a workaround. Simply go and download [AIMP player](https://www.aimp.ru/?do=download) ([portable version](https://portableapps.com/apps/music_video/aimp-portable)) and install it on your computer. Although AIMP is designed for Windows, you can use [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) to run it on Linux. [Sorry Mac users, I don't like Apple and don't know how to use it well, but I think you can also use Wine -not sure tho-.]

- Once you run AIMP you go to ```MENU > Preferences``` or hit ```Ctrl + P```.
- Go to ```Plugins > Last.fm``` and follow the instructions in the pop-up window to login with your account (will lauch authentication on browser).

- Drag and drop any of the HLS files (```.m3u``` or ```.pls```) to AIMP queue and start the radio streaming.
- Enjoy your listening and scrobbling.
- Note that not every radio station shows the tags of the music you're listening to and some of them will transmit this data in wrong order, e.g. swapped ```<artist>``` and ```<title>``` tags and it will be reflected on your Last.fm account.
